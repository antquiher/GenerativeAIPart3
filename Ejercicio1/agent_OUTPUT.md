User > I want to convert 500 US Dollars to Euros using my Platinum Credit Card. How much will I receive?

currency_agent > The final amount you will receive is 455.7 Euros.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Fee Calculation:** A fee of 2% will be charged on 500 USD.
    *   Fee percentage: 2%
    *   Fee amount: 10 USD
    *   Amount after fee: 500 USD - 10 USD = 490 USD

2.  **Currency Conversion:** The remaining 490 USD will be converted to EUR using the exchange rate of 0.93.
    *   Exchange rate: 1 USD = 0.93 EUR
    *   Converted amount: 490 USD * 0.93 = 455.7 EUR
